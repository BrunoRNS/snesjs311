# snesjs311

This is a modified version of SnesJS by @angelo-wf also licensed by MIT
This is not a javascript emulator for you to upload your ROMs and play like original SnesJS is.

### With this version you can create web pages with the "main.smc" being your own snes ROM.

main.smc is blank in this repository for you just swap it for your ROM.
If you have a sfc or bin ROM just rename it as a smc ROM that might work as well.

I won't upgrade this repository so early if I will, but if you want to contribute with this project:
- Share an issue
- Begin a discussion
- Send a pull request

Or even better, fork this repo and upgrade this simple code.

# Atention

- This is not fast as it could be, >512 kb ROMs will be too much for a good emulation.

This project is not affliated with, nor authorized, endorsed or licensed in any way by Nintendo Corporation, 
its affliates or subsidiaries. No SNES ROMs are included in this repository!
